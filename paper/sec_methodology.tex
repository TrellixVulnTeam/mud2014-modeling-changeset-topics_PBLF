Rough outline of methodology:

Gather corpora.
Get words from corpora.
Filter the words by splitting compound words and removing stop words.
Do not stem words because Biggers and Kraft found that the null stemmer was just as effective as six other stemmers in feature location techniques using LDA~\cite{Biggers-Kraft:2012}
Put filtered words from change sets into gensim to create topic models.
Put filtered words from release method into gensim to create topic models.
Test both types of models for topic distinctness.
Analyze effectiveness based on topic distinctness.


"Traditional metrics are, indeed, negatively correlated with the
measures of topic quality developed in this paper.  Our measures enable
new forms of model selection and suggest that practitioners developing
topic models should thus focus on evaluations that depend on real-world
task performance rather than optimizing likelihood-based measures." ~\cite{Chang-etal:2009}
