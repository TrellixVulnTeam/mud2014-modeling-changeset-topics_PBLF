Rough outline of methodology

Gather corpora.
Get words from corpora.
Filter the words by splitting compound words and removing stop words.
Do not stem words because Biggers and Kraft found that the null stemmer was just as effective as six other stemmers in feature location techniques using LDA~\cite{Biggers-Kraft:2012}
Put filtered words from change sets into gensim to create topic models.
Put filtered words from release method into gensim to create topic models.
Test both types of models for topic distinctness.
Analyze effectiveness based on topic distinctness.


"Traditional metrics are, indeed, negatively correlated with the
measures of topic quality developed in this paper.  Our measures enable
new forms of model selection and suggest that practitioners developing
topic models should thus focus on evaluations that depend on real-world
task performance rather than optimizing likelihood-based measures." ~\cite{Chang-etal:2009}

\caption{Example of a \texttt{git diff}. Black or blue lines denote metadata about the change, red lines (beginning with a single \texttt{-}) denote line removals, and green lines (beginning with a single \texttt{+}) denote line additions.}
\label{fig:diff}
\end{figure}

To extract text from the change-sets, we look at the output of viewing
the \texttt{git diff} between two commits.
Figure~\ref{fig:diff} shows an example of what a change-set might look
like in Git.

In our change-set text extractor, we only extract text from removed or added lines.
Context and metadata lines are ignored.
Figure~\ref{fig:diffdocument} shows what words would be extracted to make up the document without preprocessing
from the change shown in Figure~\ref{fig:diff}.

\subsection{Modeling}

For our topic modeling, we use the open source Python library Gensim~\cite{Gensim}.
We set the LDA parameters as follows:
$100$ topics ($K$),
a symmetric $\alpha=0.1$,
$\beta$ is left as a default value of $1/K$ (also $0.1$).
Since Gensim's LDA implementation is based on the
Online LDA by Hoffman et al.~\ref{Hoffman-etal:2010},
it uses variational inference instead of a Collapsed Gibbs Sampler.
In order to ensure that the model converges for each document,
we allow LDA to see each document $10$ times by setting
Gensim's intialization parameter \texttt{passes}.
