\begin{abstract}

Topic modeling has been applied to several areas of software engineering,
such as bug localization, feature location, triaging change requests,
and traceability link recovery.
Many of these approaches combine mining unstructured data, such as bug
reports, with topic modeling a release snapshot of source code.
However, source code evolves, causing the models to quickly go stale.
In this paper, we explore the approach of topic modeling \emph{changesets}
over the "traditional" release approach.
We conduct an exploratory study of four open source systems:
three written in Java and the last in C.
We investigate the differences in corpora in each project,
and evaluate the topic distinctiveness of the models.
We find that we are all really cool people.
